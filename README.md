What is MediaGoblin?

* A place to store all your different media (photos, videos, audios,
  and more!) that’s as awesome as, if not more awesome than, existing
  network services (Flickr, YouTube, etc)
* Customizable!
* A place for people to collaborate and show off original and derived
  creations.  Free, as in freedom.  We’re a GNU project after all.
* Extensible: Plugins allow you to add new media types (3d models?
  Presentations and documents?  Yes, and more!) or extend old ones.
* A real community, and we'd love to have you join us!
