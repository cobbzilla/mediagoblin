MediaGoblin is a free software media publishing platform that anyone can run.
You can think of it as a decentralized alternative to Flickr, YouTube,
SoundCloud. It's also:

* The perfect tool to show and share your media!
* Building tools to empower the world through decentralization!
* Built for extensibility. Multiple media types, including video support!
* Part of the GNU project and devoted to user freedom.
* Powered by a community of people like you.

MediaGoblin is a self-hosted web application that you install on a server you or
your organisation controls. See our [Deploying
