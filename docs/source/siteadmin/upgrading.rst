 Upgrading MediaGoblin
======================

Updating to a new release of MediaGoblin
----------------------------------------

Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~

*ALWAYS* do backups before upgrading, especially before running migrations! That
way if something goes wrong, we can fix things!

And be sure to shut down your current MediaGoblin/Celery processes before
upgrading!


Upgrade (already on Python 3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Update to the latest release.  In your ``mediagoblin`` directory, run:
   ``git fetch && git checkout -q v0.10.0 && git submodule update``
2. Remove your existing installation:
   ``rm -rf bin include lib lib64 node_modules``
3. Install MediaGoblin:
   ``./bootstrap.sh && ./configure && make``
4. Update the database:
   ``./bin/gmg dbupdate``
5. Restart MediaGoblin


Upgrade (upgrading to Python 3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Refer to the "Dependences" and "Configure PostgreSQL" sections of
   ":doc:`deploying`" to install the necessary Python 3 dependencies.
2. Update to the latest release.  In your ``mediagoblin`` directory, run:
   ``git fetch && git checkout -q stable && git submodule update``
3. Remove your existing installation:
   ``rm -rf bin include lib lib64 node_modules``
4. Install MediaGoblin:
   ``./bootstrap.sh && ./configure && make``
5. Update the database:
   ``./bin/gmg dbupdate``
6. Restart MediaGoblin


Updating your system Python
---------------------------

Upgrading your operating system or installing a new version of
Python may break MediaGoblin. This typically occurs because Python virtual
environment is referring to a copy of Python that no longer exists. To fix this:

1. In your ``mediagoblin`` directory, remove your existing installation:
   ``rm -rf bin include lib lib64 node_modules``
2. Install MediaGoblin:
   ``./bootstrap.sh && ./configure && make``
3. Update the database:
   ``./bin/gmg dbupdate``
4. Restart MediaGoblin
