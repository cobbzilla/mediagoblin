# Storage interface & basic file implementation
###############################################

class StorageInterface:
    """
    Interface for the storage API.

    This interface doesn't actually provide behavior, but it defines
    what kind of storage patterns subclasses should provide.

    It is important to note that the storage API idea of a "filepath"
    is actually like ['dir1', 'dir2', 'file.jpg'], so keep that in
    mind while reading method documentation.

    You should set up your __init__ method with whatever keyword
    arguments are appropriate to your storage system, but you should
    also passively accept all extraneous keyword arguments like:

      def __init__(self, **kwargs):
          pass

    See BasicFileStorage as a simple implementation of the
    StorageInterface.
