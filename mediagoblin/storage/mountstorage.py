    Experimental "Mount" virtual Storage Interface

    This isn't an interface to some real storage, instead it's a
    redirecting interface, that redirects requests to other
    "StorageInterface"s.

    For example, say you have the paths:

     1. ['user_data', 'cwebber', 'avatar.jpg']
     2. ['user_data', 'elrond', 'avatar.jpg']
     3. ['media_entries', '34352f304c3f4d0ad8ad0f043522b6f2', 'thumb.jpg']

    You could mount media_entries under CloudFileStorage and user_data
    under BasicFileStorage.  Then 1 would be passed to
    BasicFileStorage under the path ['cwebber', 'avatar.jpg'] and 3
    would be passed to CloudFileStorage under
    ['34352f304c3f4d0ad8ad0f043522b6f2', 'thumb.jpg'].

    In other words, this is kind of like mounting /home/ and /etc/
    under different filesystems on your operating system... but with
    mediagoblin filestorages :)

    To set this up, you currently need to call the mount() method with
    the target path and a backend, that shall be available under that
    target path.  You have to mount things in a sensible order,
    especially you can't mount ["a", "b"] before ["a"].
